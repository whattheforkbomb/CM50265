% Why report exists (report produced for CW1 of machine learning 2 - CM50265)

% Outline what will follow in the report

%   Discussion of creation of our own model
%       Wherein we will discuss approaches to reduce over-fitting, how the model was trained, issues faced, evaluate effectiveness (maybe compare to image net top 50)

%   Discussion of how we made use of existing model
%       Discuss which model used (is there a reason why), what changes to approach made between our own model and the hybrid (changes to training, post-CNN layers?, evaluate performance)

%   Summary \& Comparison of the 2 approaches
%       Which was faster to train, took less training, more accurate, layer count / param count, etc
%       Plotted learning curve differences?
