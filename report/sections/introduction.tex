\section{Introduction}
This report documents the creation of two CNN models which predict the age and gender of people based on an image (128px x 128px) of their face.\\
This was performed as part of assignment 1 for the University of Bath Machine Learning unit: CM50265.

\begin{optional}
    \subsection{Development}
    Both of the CNN models were developed using Python 3 and Keras. Once trained, the models were saved; links to the models can be found on the cover-page for this report.\\
    Development was performed using Google Colab, using a mixture of free cloud compute time (utilizing GPU resources) and running locally on our own machines. 
\end{optional}
    
    \subsection{Report Structure}
We shall begin by discussing the development of 'Model A', a CNN model built from scratch by ourselves.\\
This shall entail an overview of the final model architecture, the means through which it was trained, and a short summary of it's performance.\\
This section will include information on hyper-parameter identification and tuning, model adjustments made to reduce over-fitting, and how the provided dataset was augmented.\\

Following this we will discuss the development of 'Model B', a CNN model built upon an existing model trained on ImageNet.\\
As with the prior section, we shall provide an overview of the final model architecture, the means through which it was trained, and a short summary of it's performance.\\
This section will also include information on hyper-parameter identification and tuning, and model adjustments made to reduce over-fitting.\\

The report will then be concluded with a summary which will compare the two models.
