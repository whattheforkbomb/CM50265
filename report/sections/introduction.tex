% Outline what will follow in the report

%   Discussion of creation of our own model
%       Wherein we will discuss approaches to reduce over-fitting, how the model was trained, issues faced, evaluate effectiveness (maybe compare to image net top 50)

%   Discussion of how we made use of existing model
%       Discuss which model used (is there a reason why), what changes to approach made between our own model and the hybrid (changes to training, post-CNN layers?, evaluate performance)

%   Summary \& Comparison of the 2 approaches
%       Which was faster to train, took less training, more accurate, layer count / param count, etc

\section{Introduction}
This report documents the creation of two CNN models to predict the age and gender of people based on the their face, present within 128px by 128px photos.



Firstly discuss the creation, training, and performance (regarding validation) of a bespoke model.

This will be followed by the same, but with regards to model created on top of an existing model pre-trained on ImageNet

The report will be concluded with a summary which will compare the two models, and discuss further work.
