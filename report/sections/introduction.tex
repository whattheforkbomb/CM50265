% Outline what will follow in the report

%   Discussion of creation of our own model
%       Wherein we will discuss approaches to reduce over-fitting, how the model was trained, issues faced, evaluate effectiveness (maybe compare to image net top 50)

%   Discussion of how we made use of existing model
%       Discuss which model used (is there a reason why), what changes to approach made between our own model and the hybrid (changes to training, post-CNN layers?, evaluate performance)

%   Summary \& Comparison of the 2 approaches
%       Which was faster to train, took less training, more accurate, layer count / param count, etc

\section{Introduction}
This report documents the creation of two CNN models which predict the age and gender of people based on an image (128px x 128px) of their face. The first model was created from scratch and learns entirely from the training data. The second is a finetuned model using a base trained on ImageNet. This base is combined with new output layers and retrained to predict age and gender. The perfomance of these models is analysed and compared.


Both of the CNN models were developed using Python 3 and Keras. Once trained, the models were saved; links to the models can be found on the cover-page for this report.\\
Development was performed using Google Colab, using a mixture of free cloud compute time (utilizing GPU resources) and running locally on our own machines.
