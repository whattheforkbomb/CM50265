\section{Introduction}
This report documents the creation of two CNN models which predict the age and gender of people based on an image (128px x 128px) of their face.\\
The first model was created from scratch and learns entirely from the training data. The second is a pre-trained model using a base trained on ImageNet. This base is combined with new output layers and retrained to predict age and gender.\\
The performance of these models is analysed and compared.

Both of the CNN models were developed using Python 3 and Keras. Once trained, the models were saved; links to the models can be found on the cover-page for this report.\\
Development was performed using Google Colab, using a mixture of free cloud compute time (utilizing GPU resources) and running locally on our own machines.
