% Data augmentation
%   Image rotation, zoom, shifting, mirroring
%   Possible layer to convert to greyscale to reduce number of params to train
%   Could actually be own section as shared between both models?

% Model walkthrough
%   Final model shape (layer count, params) 
% Total params: 1,045,058
% Trainable params: 1,044,162
% Non-trainable params: 896

%   Hyper-params (and potentially tuning?)
%   approaches to reduce over-fitting (drop-out, regularisation (still need to add))
%   approaches to reduce vanishing gradients (additive layers)
%   approaches to vanishing weights (leaky-relu and normalisation)
%   Distinct CNN layers (for feature extraction) and FCN layers (for classification)
%   probs not image of graph (as massive), but can add to appendix


% Training and learning
%   Time to train, params, layers, etc
%   Learning curves
