% Data augmentation
%   Image rotation, zoom, shifting, mirroring
%   Could actually be own section as shared between both models?

% Model walkthrough
%   Final model shape (layer count, params)
%   Hyper-params (and potentially tuning?)
%   Model used (ResNet50) - why?
%   approaches to reduce over-fitting (drop-out, regularisation (still need to add))
%   approaches to reduce vanishing gradients (additive layers)
%   approaches to vanishing weights (leaky-relu)
%   FCN layers (different to model A?)
%   probs not image of graph (as massive), but can add to appendix


% Training and learning
%   Time to train, etc
%   Learning curves

% Link to colab notebook
