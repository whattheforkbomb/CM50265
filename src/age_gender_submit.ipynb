Please read carefully all the instructions before you start to write your code.\n","\n","**Your tasks**\n","\n","You need train two CNN models:\n","- one is defined by you with a few restrictions and be trained from scratch, save it as `age_gender_A.h5`\n","- the other is to finetune a pretrained model, save it as `age_gender_B.h5`\n","\n","**Dataset**\n","\n","Your models will be trained and validated on a folder `train_val/` containing 5,000 labeled face images (size: 128 x 128), originated from the UTKFace dataset.

But many people found they reached its limit far less than 12 hours.). Therefore, I would give you three suggestions to mimimise the risk of reaching the limit.\n","\n","1. Make sure you have a stable internet connection.\n","2. Double check all the hyperparameters are good before you start to train the model.\n","3. According to my experience, each model should be trained in less than 2 hours. If much longer than that, you'd better consider adjusting the architecture."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vOAXA2CdQ8Pb"},"source":["## Setting Up: Mount the google drive\n","Mount your google drive to the notebook. \n","\n","Also don't forget to **enable GPU** before your training.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XCwBWDsMQwyb"},"source":["#\n","# Add your code here\n","#\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lBRVYYhRRINA"},"source":["## Visualize a few photos\n","It is always benificial to know your data well before you start.
